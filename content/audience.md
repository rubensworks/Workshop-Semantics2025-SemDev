## Audience and Community
{:#audience}

<!-- Who and how many people are likely to attend? Demonstrate that there is an existing community interested in the topic, e.g., by providing references for recent papers related to the core topic of the workshop and/or a discussion of why the workshop would attract submissions. -->

The Developers Workshop from 2015-2016 was popular, and attracted more than 70 participants during the conference.
That workshop had different organizers, so this workshop is not a strict continuation.
The [2015 Developers Workshop at ESWC](https://eswc2015.semdev.org/){:.mandatory} had 15 accepted software presentations and 5 interactive discussions.
Given that no workshops with a similar focus have been organized at ISWC and ESWC for nearly ten years,
we foresee a high interest with novel software that accumulated during these years that are not ready for the ISWC resources track,
but would be relevant in a more focussed format at this developers' workshop.
The workshop will have a low barrier to entry for audience participants, only basic Semantic Web knowledge is required.
