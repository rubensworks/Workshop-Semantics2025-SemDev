      <h2 property="schema:name">Abstract</h2>
      <!-- Context      -->
      <p>Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph technologies have undoubtedly had a tremendous impact on today’s world.
While academia and industry are both highly active in this field,
there is often a disconnect between these two worlds.
<!-- Need         -->
As such, there is a need to bring these two worlds closer together.
<!-- Task         -->
The goal of this workshop is to <strong>provide a bridge between academia and industry in the form of a <em>developers workshop</em></strong>.
<!-- Object       -->
In this workshop, we invite developers of both worlds to present and discuss their software.
Furthermore, by bringing people from academia and industry physically together,
this workshop will provide a discussion ground for identifying open problems that are relevant to both sides.
<!-- Findings     -->
Besides putting a spotlight on Semantic Web software,
the workshop aims to pinpoint opportunities for future research and implementations.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
This workshop is the spiritual successor to the highly-popular Developers Workshop
that was organized at ESWC and ISWC between 2015 and 2016.
<!-- Perspectives --></p>

      <p><strong>Workshop type: Novel</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Proposed Length: Full-day</strong></p>

      <h2 property="schema:name">Motivation</h2>

      <!-- Why is the topic timely and of particular interest to ISWC participants? -->

      <p>In theory, the interplay between academia and industry is bidirectional.
Industry informs academics about real-world problems that require novel solutions.
Academics can then design novel algorithms as solutions,
which they evaluate based on software prototypes.
These research outcomes can then be picked up by industry,
and become implemented in commercial products and services.</p>

      <p>In practise, this interplay unfortunately does not flow as smooth as theorized.
First, problems in industry do not always become apparent to the research community.
This can cause real-world problems to not get picked up by researchers,
or researchers coming up with <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/the-semantic-web-identity-crisis/">solutions for which no real problem exists</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.
Second, the research outcomes that academics consider finished may still <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HqbAY1s0e0&amp;t=3409s">not be practical enough to be useful in industry</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
Moving from a research prototype towards a technical-ready implementation can still require non-trivial problems to be solved,
which can require additional research.</p>

      <p>As such, there is a need for a common ground where academics and companies can discuss real-world problems,
and gaps between research prototypes and technical-ready products.
This workshop aims to fill this need, and is therefore relevant for researchers and industrial partners.</p>

      <h2 property="schema:name">Topics</h2>

      <!-- What topics of interest will be covered by the workshop
Proposed workshops should have a core theme that is much more selective than the broader scope of the main conference.
We may reject or propose to merge workshops that overlap significantly with other workshops in terms of theme. -->

      <p>The core theme of this workshop concerns <strong>development efforts related to the Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs, and Linked Data</strong>.
An orthogonal goal is to <strong>connect academia and industry</strong> through these collective development efforts.
Possible contributions include the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Web applications</li>
        <li>Web APIs</li>
        <li>browser extensions</li>
        <li>libraries (client-side or server-side)</li>
        <li>visualizations</li>
        <li>user interfaces</li>
        <li>end-user tools</li>
        <li>development tools</li>
        <li>data or ontology processors</li>
        <li>application development (query engines, processors, reasoners, …)</li>
        <li>implementations of the semantic web standards (including RDF-star and RDF/SPARQL 1.2)</li>
        <li>…</li>

      <h2 property="schema:name">Workshop Format</h2>

      <!-- The intended mix of events, such as paper presentations, invited talks, panels, demos, and general discussion (either a tentative tabular schedule or a one paragraph summary).
We welcome workshops with an innovative structure and a diverse programme that attracts various types of contributions and ensures rich interactions. -->

      <p>Besides standard projectors, this workshop will require booths or tables for demos in the afternoon.
If possible, these booths/tables should be placed outside of the main workshop room.</p>

      <p>This workshop will invite three types of contributions:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Software talk</strong>: Participants can submit a short paper (5-6 pages, or ~2,000 words) they can present and (optionally) demonstrate at the workshop. We encourage hands-on presentations, such as live-coding.</li>
        <li><strong>Software demo</strong>: Participants can submit a link to a software repository (that has a README) they can demonstrate at the workshop.</li>
        <li><strong>Discussion topic</strong>: Participants can submit an abstract (short paragraph) to propose an interactive discussion topic.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>While we allow PDF submissions for short papers, alternative formats are also encouraged, including self-hosted HTML pages.
All accepted submissions will be included or linked to from our website.
For authors that would like their submission to be included in the published PDF proceedings,
a PDF meeting the <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/">CEUR</a> requirements must be provided.</p>

      <p>In the morning, we will have an invited talk (from Hannah Bast on the QLever SPARQL engine, pending invitation).
Afterwards, accepted software talks will be presented.
In the afternoon, the workshop will be more focused towards open discussions and interaction.
During this time, accepted software demos (ideally in a separate room or hallway) will be held in parallel with the accepted discussion topics.
As one discussion topic, we plan a panel discussion on bridging academia and industry.
Depending on the number of discussion topics, we will split the group into breakout sessions.
Each software demo will have a dedicated booth which the workshop participants can visit during or in-between the breakout sessions.</p>

<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
      <h2 property="schema:name">Review Policy</h2>

      <!-- If contributions will be peer-reviewed, whether, e.g. open review, double anonymous review, or single anonymous review will be used. -->

      <p>All contributions (talks, demos, topics) will be peer-reviewed by members of the program committee.
Talks and demos will be reviewed based on the same criteria as the <a href="https://iswc2025.semanticweb.org/#/calls/resource">ISWC resources track</a>,
but the tools can be unfinished and not well-established yet.
Discussion topics will be reviewed on relevance and potential for discussion.
To foster continued discussions after the review round with program committee members,
we will follow a fully open review policy through <a href="https://openreview.net/" class="mandatory" data-link-text="https:/​/​openreview.net/​">OpenReview</a>.</p>

      <h2 property="schema:name">Publication Policy</h2>

      <!-- The plans for preserving the workshop’s outcome, e.g., publication of workshop papers in an online repository like CEUR, invitation of selected papers to a journal special issue, etc. -->

      <p>We will publish proceedings of the workshop at <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/" class="mandatory" data-link-text="https:/​/​ceur-​ws.org/​">CEUR</a>.
This will include the short papers submitted as software talks.
Submissions as software demo and discussion topic will be invited to optionally write a paper of at least five pages (requirement of CEUR) for inclusion in the proceedings.</p>

  <section id="audience" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#audience">
<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
      <h2 property="schema:name">Audience and Community</h2>

      <!-- Who and how many people are likely to attend? Demonstrate that there is an existing community interested in the topic, e.g., by providing references for recent papers related to the core topic of the workshop and/or a discussion of why the workshop would attract submissions. -->

      <p>The Developers Workshop from 2015-2016 was popular, and attracted more than 70 participants during the conference.
That workshop had different organizers, so this workshop is not a strict continuation.
The <a href="https://eswc2015.semdev.org/" class="mandatory" data-link-text="https:/​/​eswc2015.semdev.org/​">2015 Developers Workshop at ESWC</a> had 15 accepted software presentations and 5 interactive discussions.
Given that no workshops with a similar focus have been organized at ISWC and ESWC for nearly ten years,
we foresee a high interest with novel software that accumulated during these years that are not ready for the ISWC resources track,
but would be relevant in a more focussed format at this developers’ workshop.
The workshop will have a low barrier to entry for audience participants, only basic Semantic Web knowledge is required.</p>
